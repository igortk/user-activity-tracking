## üê≥ Running via docker-compose
The main docker-compose.yml resides at the root of this repository. This *.yml file runs all the necessary services (Grafana, Prometheus, databases, API and website).
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Build the image and run all needed services
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

## üìÖ Daily job description
1. **11.10.2025**:
   - Requirements analysis and development of a follow-up work plan;
   - Development of the first API for creating user activity (POST /api/event) records and saving them to a database (PostgreSQL);
   - Development of an API for obtaining user activity based on the following criteria: user ID, start and end of the search by time (the time the record was created, not when it was active);
   - Implementation of a cron job and its jobs based on counting the number of activities for each user over a period (in our case, every 4 hours);
   - Implementation: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml;
   - Search for information on working with Grafana and Go;
2. **12.10.2025**:
   - Finding information on developing a minimal website in React;
   - Connecting Grafana to the developed API;
   - Configuring datasource and dashboards (Grafana);
   - Website development (React);
   - Implementing Dockerfiles and docker-compose for a React application;
   - Implementing a common docker-compose for more convenient deployment of all services and applications
3. **13.10.2025**:
   - Described README file;

## üìã Notes on any optional parts
1. The database stores two dates: the date the user's activity was recorded in the system and the date the activity was performed by the user (the user selects the date);

2. User activity is searched by the date the record was added to the system, not the date the activity was performed by the user;

3. Two metrics have been added to Grafana: user_activity_tracking_api_requests_total (shows the total number of requests) and user_activity_tracking_api_requests_errors_total (shows the number of requests that responded with some kind of error);
   
4. The application was split into two repositories, as it's more appropriate to keep different system levels in separate repositories. But for your convenience, I created a single shared repository where I added the submodules.

5. The cron settings were moved to the configs, as the interval may change in the future, and to make testing easier.
